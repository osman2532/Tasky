# Tasky
I made this website as a part of an assignment using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 
we can add a post.
upload a photo and give it a description.
edit the caption and the description.
delete the post.
add multiple posts.
and the posts/cards wonâ€™t disappear when reloading as I manipulated DOM elements.
